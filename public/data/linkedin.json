  "summary": "I am developer passionate about system design, developer experience, static typing and functional programming. Educated in design theory, practice, and social responsibility I fell into programming through the portal of open source, Node.js, and GitHub. Over a decade later I have found myself in love with TypeScript and at Prisma leading development on the Prisma Data Platform Control Plane. In my personal life I work on various personal and open source projects but closest to my heart are the backpacking trips I take my two boys on across our beautiful rugged Canadian wilderness! üèî üá®üá¶",
