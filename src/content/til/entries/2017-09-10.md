## Sun Sep 10

- found out that asciidoc does not support strikethough in a way that supports Github (or viceversa) [link](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/1030) [link](https://github.com/christiangalsterer/bitbucket-asciidoc-plugin/issues/15). This prevented me from being able to format a log title in the way I wanted.

##### Amazon Alexa is a kind of voice-based interface not unlike Apple Siri.

- Amazon Echo is a hardware product line that makes Alexa convenient to use
- Developers can "teach Alexa skills" which is analogus to e.g. writing iOS apps. teach -> write, skill -> app
- Alexa skills are configured with an amazon developer account, then implemented. The skill's interaction model is defined in this configuration layer, e.g. what utterances can be used.
- `Invocation Name` is the name given to enter your skill from alexa. For example `essence` will enter the `ssense` skill
- Each skill has multiple `intents`. These are like functions or endpoints in your skill. You defined them as a developer.
- Each intent has multiple `utterances`. These are ways the user can speak to execute the intent.
- There is another concept called `slots` which are for parameters in intents. But I have not actually played with these yet.
- There are different APIs available for developers to use to build skills. For highly custom skills there is a Custom API which can POST intents to any host running an HTTPS server.

- DGraph's [go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client) is their most feature complete one. DGraph's [`dgraphloader`](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/tree/master/cmd/dgraphloader) is built on top of it.
