- VSCode defaults to using its own built in TypeSript. Does not use the one a project has installed (aka. workspace). [Can be configured to](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/42243).
- `Omit` can be derived from `Exclude` but is not part of the TypeScript utility types stdlib. `Exclude` works on sets like `a | b | c` while `Omit` removes fields from an object. This and many other utility implementations can be found at https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-type.
