##### Better `git` config

- Use a global git ignore to ignore files that should always be ignored as well as files that are particular to you. For example `.vscode` is a folder that stores workspace settings. Not everyone on the team may be using `.vscode` and hence its not really the right place, ideally, to ignore it.
- Git docs about where global ignore file can be stored. The one I prefer is using `~/.config/git/ignore`: [link](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore/1.7.12).
- A gist containing what Github says is a good base for global ignore: [link](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657).

##### Serverless
