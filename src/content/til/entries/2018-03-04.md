## 2018 Sun Mar 4

- on my mind lately:
  - Just Do It
  - Graph theory and graph implementations for brand adjacency feature
  - How does an organization govern its technical evolution (technique, tools, ...)
  - Use questionaries to drive own personal profile page
  - Use aspects of profile I might want to explain or share as basis for blog posts
  - Make a PR to immer to convert to TypeScript [as per request](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer/issues/67)
  - tree shake ramda functions at library level rather than reinventing wheel
  - Polymath Inc
  - Solo blog to group blog to freelance to consultancy to service company to startup to freedom
  - Use my repeatedly validated visualization skills to explore and teach technical topics
