## Sat Oct 7

- In TypeScript using an interface versus using a type alias changes how the type is represented in IDE type tooltips. With interfaces, tooltips will show the name of the interface. For example `interface Foo {}` will show as `Foo`. However with type aliases the tooltips will contain the contents of the alias. For example `type Foo = { a: string }` will show as `{ a: string }`. I prefer the way interfaces are presented because its much more readable than having the guts of many fields splayed into a tooltip. More details can be found in [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37233735/typescript-interfaces-vs-types). Noted in this thread are two additional benefits of interfaces in TypeScript:

** An interface can be named in an extends or implements clause, but a type alias for an object type literal cannot.
** An interface can have multiple merged declarations, but a type alias for an object type literal cannot.

However at least one advantage of type aliases in TypeScript is that they can alias anything (primitives, unions, etc.), not just objects.

- [AsciiDoctor has support for list continuations of an ancestor list](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#attaching-to-an-ancestor-list).

- [mermaidjs](https://mermaidjs.github.io) seems like an awesome text-based diagraming tool

- regarding [`interface`](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/interfaces/) versus `type` in Flowtype it appears that the differences are not nearly as significant or different as in TypeScript, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43023941/flow-interfaces-versus-types[link]. It seems they are or will become identical. I like this because of the simplicity factor. More power-to-weight ratio here than in TypeScript.
