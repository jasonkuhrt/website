##### running a dgraph cluster

- multiple dgraph instances can run together in a cluster to scale read/write performance as well as provide high availability of the data
- additional configuration steps are necessary to setup a cluster
- each instance must be instructed to take on certain `group`s of predicates `--groups`
- a predicate-to-group mapping spec must be given to each instance `--group_conf`
- The mapping spec has some basic features like edge-name-prefix matching and `fp` variable for the so-called fingerprint of an edge

##### k8s

- in Kubernetes a ConfigMap resource type allows mounting file contents at file names given by the resource spec key names. for example:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    <filename_1_here>: |
      file 1 contents here!
    <filename_2_here>: |
      file 2 contents here!
  ```
