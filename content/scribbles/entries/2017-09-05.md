- [dgraph](https://dgraph.io) has enough power in its query language to apply both collaborative-based and content-based filtering strategies [link](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/recommendation) [link](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/recommendation2/).

- _collaborative-based filtering_ is a broad strategy for recommending things based upon matching like-users and then recommending to one based on another(s).

- _cold-start_ problem refers to being unable to integrate a new user into collaborative-based filtering for lack of data with that user.

- _content-based filtering_ is a broad strategy for recommending things based on their similarity to another given thing.
