- Occam's Razor is a principal that when problem solving no more assumptions should be made than necessary. It states that given a set of hypotheses the one which makes the fewest assumptions should be selected. In practice, in science, it is used as a heuristic guide in the development of theoretical models, rather than a rigorous rule forcing selection between models.
