##### hub issue

- Finally played with `git issue` command via `hub`
- Up to now had only even played with `gh is`
- Nothing against `gh` but nice to have `issue` available in `hub` so that I don't _need_ node etc. deps for this functionality
- Also seems fastesr than I remember `gh is` being though unclear if its IO related e.g. Github API got faster
