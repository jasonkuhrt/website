- Python PEP in 2006 for defining the concept of function annotations, just syntax, no inherent semantics
- Python PEP in 2014 for defining a type system living syntactically within these annotations
- Inspired by work down in MyPy

- [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga) is like create-react-app for building a graphql server.
- This [Prisma blog post about 2.0 bindings](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-binding-2-0-improved-api-schema-transforms-automatic-codegen-5934cd039db1/) shows some examples of a GQL Gateway calling into GQL microservices. The deeper aka. lower level service exposed a CRUD api however the gateway exposed a DSL. For example the microservice has `create_post` and `update_post` but the gateway has `create_draft` and `publish`. This design pattern may be relevant in some future.
