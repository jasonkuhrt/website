- Defining the terms of lambda calculus is highly inconsistent in the material I have been reading. In http://haskellbook.com/[Haskell book] the basic lambda terms are: expressions, abstractions, variables. In [this article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) they are: variables, abstractions, applications. In [this article](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf) they are: expressions, abstractions, applications.
