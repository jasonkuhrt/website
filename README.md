### Permalinked Assets

Files in `/assets/permalinked/` are emitted into the public root. For example `/assets/permalinked/resume.pdf` is hosted at `/resume.pdf`. This folder is for important assets that should have root-level permalinks. The file name of an asset dictates its URI, so choose it _wisely_ before releasing the URI publicly, so that ideally it [the name] never changes.
